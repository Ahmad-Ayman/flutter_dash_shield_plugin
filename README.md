## üöÄ Installation

Add `dash_shield` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dash_shield: ^0.0.1
```

Then, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prevent Screenshots and Recording

You can prevent screenshots and screen recording in two ways:

#### a) Globally for the Entire App

To prevent screenshots and recording across the entire app, use the following:

```dart
import 'package:dash_shield/dash_shield.dart';

await DashShield.preventScreenshotsGlobally();
```

This will apply a global security setting, ensuring no screen in the app can be captured or
recorded, and for re-allowing this programmatically use the following :

```dart
import 'package:dash_shield/dash_shield.dart';

await DashShield.allowScreenshotsGlobally();
```

#### b) For Specific Screens

If you need to prevent screenshots and recording only on certain screens, Dash Shield provides a
targeted approach to apply security only where it‚Äôs needed. This is useful for protecting sensitive
screens while leaving others unaffected, and re-allowing it when leaving this screen.

```dart
class Step2 extends StatefulWidget {
  const Step2({super.key});

  @override
  State<Step2> createState() => _Step2State();
}

class _Step2State extends State<Step2> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    /// Prevent Screenshot for this screen.
    DashShield.preventScreenshotsAndRecording();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    /// Allow screenshots when leaving this screen
    DashShield.allowScreenshots(); 
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void deactivate() {
    /// Allow screenshots when leaving this screen
    DashShield.allowScreenshots(); 
    super.deactivate();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sensitive Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
              child: Text(
                      'Content on this screen is secure from screenshots and recording.')),
    );
  }
}

```

In this example, calling DashShield.preventScreenshotsAndRecording() inside the build method of a
specific screen will restrict screenshots and recordings only for that screen. This targeted
restriction allows you to control the security of individual screens without affecting the rest of
the app.

> **Tip**: Place the `preventScreenshotsAndRecording()` call at the top of the `build` method for
> clarity, ensuring it activates as soon as the screen is rendered.

### 2. **Apply SSL Pinning**

Dash Shield allows you to secure network connections by enforcing SSL pinning with custom
certificates, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This functionality is compatible with
the `Dio` client for now, other clients will be supported soon.

To apply SSL pinning:

```dart
import 'package:dash_shield/dash_shield.dart';

List<String> certificatePaths = [
  'assets/certificates/my_cert.pem',
  'assets/certificates/my_cert_2.crt'
];
await DashShield.applySSLPinning(certificatePaths, dioClient);
```

- **certificatePaths**: A list of paths to `.pem` or `.crt` certificate files located in your
  assets.
- **client**: The HTTP client (such as `Dio`) used for network requests.

> **Tip**: Make sure to include your certificate files in the project‚Äôs assets and reference them
> in `pubspec.yaml` to ensure they load correctly.

### 3. **App Integrity Checks**

Dash Shield offers configurable app integrity checks to detect security vulnerabilities such as
debugging, developer mode, emulation, and more. You can tailor these checks to suit your app‚Äôs
security needs.

#### a) Define a Security Configuration

To set up integrity checks, create a `SecurityConfig` instance with the necessary parameters:

```dart
import 'package:dash_shield/dash_shield.dart';

final securityConfig = SecurityConfig(
  androidSigningCertHashes: ['sha256hash1', 'sha256hash2'],
  androidPackageName: 'com.example.app',
  iosBundleIds: ['com.example.app.ios'],
  iosTeamId: 'TEAMID',
  watcherEmail: 'security@example.com',
  enableOnAndroid: true,
  enableOniOS: true,
);
```

- **androidSigningCertHashes**: List of SHA256 hashes for Android app signing.
- **androidPackageName**: Package name for the Android app.
- **iosBundleIds**: List of iOS bundle IDs.
- **iosTeamId**: Team ID for iOS app signing.
- **watcherEmail**: Email for receiving alerts when integrity issues are detected.
- **enableOnAndroid** and **enableOniOS**: Toggles to enable or disable checks for each platform.

#### b) Initialize Security Checks

After configuring, initialize the security checks with the following:

```dart
await DashShield.initSecurity(config:securityConfig);
```

This will activate the specified integrity checks to safeguard your app.

### Custom Actions for Integrity Checks

You can define custom actions to respond to specific integrity issues:

```dart

final securityConfig = SecurityConfig(
...
checksToEnable: [SecOnControlsToApply.appIntegrity, SecOnControlsToApply.debug],
generalAction: (issue) => print('General Action Triggered: $issue'),
specificActions: {
  SecOnControlsToApply.appIntegrity: (issue) => print('App integrity check failed: $issue'),
},
);
```

- **checksToEnable**: List of specific checks to enable.
- **generalAction**: Function to execute for any detected integrity issue if no specific action is
  set.
- **specificActions**: Map of individual actions for each check, allowing for tailored responses to
  different security concerns.

> **Tip**: Setting custom actions allows you to implement different responses, like logging or
> alerting, based on the type of integrity check that fails.

### 4. **Print Removal and Replacing**

Dash Shield includes a print management tool to help you clean up or control debugging logs in your
project. This feature allows you to remove all `print` statements from your code or wrap them
with `kDebugMode`, making it easy to manage debug output in production builds.

To access the print management tool, run the following command:

```bash
dart run dash_shield:main
```

You‚Äôll see a command-line menu with the following options:

- **Remove All Prints**: Select this option to search through your Dart files and automatically
  remove all `print` statements. This ensures that no debug logs are left in your code, streamlining
  production builds and reducing unnecessary log output.

- **Wrap All Prints with kDebugMode**: Choose this option to wrap each `print` statement
  with `kDebugMode`, making them visible only in debug mode. This is a quick way to retain useful
  debug information without exposing it in production.

> **Note**: Using these options helps ensure that sensitive or unnecessary logs are managed
> efficiently in production-ready code.

## üöÄ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please ensure:

- The `Dio` client is correctly configured for SSL pinning.
- Your certificate files are included in the project‚Äôs asset bundle and referenced correctly
  in `pubspec.yaml`.
